                    Hi, it's Jared. I'm a second-year cognitive science major and the current owner of computer store Sparky & Geeks @ UCSD. With a decade's worth of experience in computer and software engineering (specifically computer networks and programming), I became the sysadmin of our roommate's Minecraft server in 2019, and subsequently of my family's home lab server now in 2021. As a software developer I'm also quite active in open-source communities and developer forums, where I get the chance to network with people and become part of the community. I also have a fair amount of experience in residential electrical systems. In fact, one of my dream jobs is being a part-time electrician. Besides engineering, I'm also interested in entrepreneurship. Notably the two companies that I have in mind so far are Retmax (formally Rex) Inc. (technology company) and its subsidiary eLitet (pronounced Elite-T) (telecommunication company). When not working or studying, I would go to the beach, hang out with friends, roll up joints (just kidding), and get drunk. While having fun I may also reflect on rationalities behind human behaviors as part of my own research project and develop understandings of the interrelationship between networked computer systems and human social networks, which I found in recent years quite fascinating. At home, I listen to songs all the time. I may fit into the definition of "music junky" since I'm generally very accepting of various music genres. My top genre according to Spotify is country, which isn't surprising because I like the "down-to-earth"-ness of country songs. Occasionally I make memes for gags and fun. I'm also a senior member of UCSD's official Reddit community.
